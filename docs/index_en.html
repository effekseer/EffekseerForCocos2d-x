		<h1>Effekseer For Cocos2d-x</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>
        Effekseer is a tool that makes it easy to create beautiful particle effects. This library allows you to play particle effects created with Effekseer on Cocos2d-x.
        This document describes cooperation between Effekseer and Cocos2d-x.
        The library consists of multiple source code files, and you can install it by adding the source code file to the project of Cocos2d-x.
		</p>

		<p>
		The corresponding environment is as follows.

		<h2>Installation method</h2>
		<p>
		<b>Players/Cocos2d-x_v3</b>following files to the directory exists.
		</p>

<ul>
<li>Effekseer.cpp</li>
<li>Effekseer.h</li>
<li>EffekseerNative.cpp</li>
<li>EffekseerNative.h</li>
<li>EffekseerRendererNative.cpp</li>
<li>EffekseerRendererNative.h</li>
</ul>

		<p>
		Please copy these files to the project of Cocos 2d - x and add it to compile them.
		</p>


		<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>
        In <b>Samples/</b> directory in Cocos2d-x is a sample to play the particle effects of Effekseer. Since this document only explains basic usage, please see the sample for detailed usage.
</p>

<p>
    These samples, for this library is not included, please copy the library of files in each sample of <b>Classes/Effekseer</b> directory.
    <b>copyEffekseerFiles.txt</b> file exists in the directory to copy to as the marker of the directory to which the library is copied.
</p>

<h3>About files that can be played</h3>

<p>
    Only files saved by Effekseer's standard output can be played. The saved file contains the relative path from Effekseer's project to the image. For that reason, you need to place the image while keeping the relative path from the file saved in standard output to the image.
</p>

<h3>Basic playback</h3>

<p>
Play effects files saved with Effekseer's standard output with Cocos2d-x. For more information, please look at the source code that is stored in the <b>Samples/Simple/</b>.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Include Effekseer.h.
</p>

<pre>
#include "Effekseer/Effekseer.h"
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Add efk::EffectManager* to the member variable of the class that inherits cocos2d::Scene or cocos2d::Layer.
</p>

<pre>
class HelloWorld : public cocos2d::Scene /* Layer */ {
efk::EffectManager* manager = nullptr;
...
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Create an instance of efk::EffectManager*.
</p>

<pre>
manager = efk::EffectManager::create(Director::getInstance()->getVisibleSize());
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Load the effect file.
</p>

<pre>
auto effect = efk::Effect::create("Laser01.efk");
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Generate the emitter, set the parameters and add it to the scene.
</p>

<pre>
auto emitter = efk::EffectEmitter::create(manager);
emitter->setEffect(effect);
emitter->setPlayOnEnter(true);

emitter->setPosition(Vec2(300, 300));
emitter->setScale(20);
this->addChild(emitter, 0);

// No need (because it uses autorelease after 1.41)
//effect->release();
</pre>

<p>
Update the manager every frame.
</p>

<pre>
manager->update();
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Inherit visit and add a process to actually draw the effect.
</p>

<pre>
void HelloWorld::visit(
	cocos2d::Renderer *renderer, 
	const cocos2d::Mat4& parentTransform, 
	uint32_t parentFlags)
{
	manager->begin(renderer, _globalZOrder);
	cocos2d::Scene::visit(renderer, parentTransform, parentFlags);
	manager->end(renderer, _globalZOrder);
}
</pre>
<br>

<p>
Discard the manager at the end.
</p>

<pre>
HelloWorld::~HelloWorld()
{
	manager->release();
}
</pre>

<h3>3D</h3>

<p>Please read a sample in <b>Samples/3D/</b>. </p>

<p>You need to add a camera in cocos2d-x's Scene</p>

<pre>
auto s = Director::getInstance()->getWinSize();
camera = Camera::createPerspective(60, (GLfloat)s.width / s.height, 1, 1000);
camera->setPosition3D(Vec3(100, 100, 100));
camera->lookAt(Vec3(0, 0, 0), Vec3(0, 1, 0));
camera->setCameraFlag(cocos2d::CameraFlag::USER1);
</pre>


<p>
In addition to update the manager, you need to set camera parameters into the manager.
</p>
		
<pre>
manager->update();
manager->setCameraMatrix(camera->getViewMatrix());
manager->setProjectionMatrix(camera->getProjectionMatrix());
</pre>

<h3>Network</h3>

<p>You can edit the playing effect in an application (game etc.) via the network from the outside when application is running.</p>

<img src="img/network.png" width="800">

<p>Create an instance of server and execute makeNetworkServerEnabled with the port to be connected from Effekseer as the argument of this function. </p>

<pre>
networkSever = efk::NetworkServer::create();
networkSever->makeNetworkServerEnabled(60000);
</pre>

<p>
In addition to update the manager, you need to update the server. Then you can edit the effect from Effekseer. In order to edit the effect from another computer, it is necessary to open the port with the setting of the firewall.
</p>

<pre>
manager->update();
networkSever->update();
</pre>
